### Designing Home Theaters and Listening Rooms
<details>

<summary>Part 1</summary>

#### Introduction
Designing a custom home theater is often as much a matter of visual aesthetics and atmosphere as it is sound or video quality. High levels of ornamentation are no assurance of good sound, although expectations will undoubtedly be high. Getting good sound is a separate exercise, and few interior designers are aware of, much less sympathetic to, acoustical needs. One is sometimes presented with a visually attractive—depending on individual taste—design at the outset. The large screen is featured, but all else is expected as if by magic, to be massaged to fit within the visible shell. In some designs, most of the interior surfaces are covered with fabric, which hides much ugliness, but which can contribute to making the theater overly dead unless the fabric is acoustically transparent. The loudspeaker and acoustical requirements need to be conveyed to the interior designer at the earliest possible stage. There may well be “negotiations,” but when the lights are down, the ornaments fade, but the sound remains. Let it be a challenge to the creativity of the designer to deliver a pleasant visual design that does not compromise the sound or the picture. For the interior designer, the theater is the product. For audio people, the sound is the product. Compromises may be necessary.

For many designers and owners, it is assumed that the loudspeakers should be invisible. This is not always possible, and if the highest level of performance is desired, it may not be desirable. Industrial-strength appliances are somehow fashionable in domestic kitchens, where they are probably not necessary, but loudspeakers that provide beautiful music of all kinds and an essential component to movies must be invisible? Obviously, I’m biased!

The video side of theatrical presentations tends to be under excellent control when displays are professionally calibrated to be spectrally “neutral.” This guide focuses on what is necessary to deliver neutrally balanced sound—a transparent “window” into the audio that is recorded. This is what listeners have for decades told researchers that they like. However, what we see and hear are both dictated by the program content, and that is not always of the highest standard. The world’s perfect audio/video system is still at the mercy of recorded programs. When they are good, the results can be enormously impressive.
Although there is a lot of discussion about custom home theaters, the reality is that few people can afford them, and not everybody who can afford them wants them. The good news is that, with few compromises, very high-quality video and audio are possible in multipurpose rooms—where we live. Acoustical needs are real, but they can often be achieved using “stealth” techniques that still leave a visually attractive room when movies are not rolling. There are choices to be made.

Some people think that home theaters are the “poor cousins” of cinemas. For the bulk of the population this is unfortunately true. Small, low budget systems can be highly entertaining, even though they may fall short of the highest goals. Most people cannot generate, or their neighbors will not tolerate, the thundering bass and high sound levels experienced in cinemas. Nevertheless, thanks to progress in loudspeaker design and manufacturing, even modest systems can approach the sound quality of “big ticket” systems. Paying more is not an assurance of higher sound quality, although industrial design and sound output may be more impressive.

Those of us who have experienced state-of-the-art home theaters know what is possible. Stereo music, video music concerts and movies can be spine-chillingly good. However, the irony is that the sound in many cinemas and some dubbing stages is not impressive; not something to be emulated in our homes. Recent surveys have indicated that, due to costs, a high percentage of movie sound is mixed in home-theater-sized facilities, using cone and dome loudspeakers. This could be a good tendency from the home entertainment perspective; however sound quality in movies is not reliable, as a result of unfortunately ill-conceived and poorly executed calibration procedures. Chapter 11 explains the situation. Years ago, I would sometimes play a good music CD after watching a movie, just to confirm that I had just spent the better part of two hours listening to mediocre sound. 

The book discusses loudspeakers in detail, concluding that if they are chosen with care the rest of the task becomes much simpler. Room EQ cannot turn a sow’s ear into a silk purse, to recycle an old expression. In fact, if properly designed loudspeakers are chosen, room EQ should be avoided at frequencies above about 500 Hz because there is a risk of degrading them—the book explains this in detail (Sections 13.2.3 p. 371, 12.2.3 p. 348, 4.6.3 p. 84). Two ears and a brain are much more analytical than a small microphone and a spectrum analyzer. Much of what we perceive involves a cognitive component that is totally missing from steady-state in-room measurements.

In movie sound the center channel is the workhorse—the most important loudspeaker in the room—yet in some systems it is almost an afterthought, occasionally even omitted. Similarly, the surround loudspeakers, which do much less work, are no less important when it comes to the requirement for sound quality excellence. Budget and space limits force many compromises, but if it is possible, the surround and elevation/immersive loudspeakers should be designed to the same sound quality standards as the front L, C, and R loudspeakers. The ideal situation is that the surround and immersive loudspeakers are smaller versions of the L, C and R loudspeakers, mounted so that the prime listening location receives direct sound radiated on axis or at least within the listening window of the loudspeaker (i.e., not more than 30 degrees off axis. The latter is something that in- or on-wall designs compromise because the direct sound arriving at the prime listener is sometimes a far off-axis response. Done properly, the result is a seamless sense of space and envelopment, but obviously this presents challenges in a space where loudspeakers are intended to be “invisible.” If spinorama or similarly comprehensive data are available, brands and models can be mixed if they exhibit close similarity. This opens up alternatives, but nevertheless, an adjustment of aesthetic priorities may be required.

We are much more critical of sound quality when listening to a single channel, which is why subjective loudspeaker evaluations should be conducted in mono (see Chapter 3 and Section 7.4.2, p. 174). In movies and television the center channel is often operating alone—monophonically—as do other channels from time to time, and at those times both the loudspeaker and the room around it are under close scrutiny.
Stereo reproduction is built around mono left, mono right and double-mono for amplitude-panned phantom images, including the featured artist in the center location. Only if there are uncorrelated captured or synthesized room ambience sounds is the situation more complicated. The result is that the L and R loudspeakers matter a great deal, and the room contributes to the effect . . . but, its contribution is most often one of redirecting off-axis radiations from loudspeakers in the direction of listeners. If those sounds leaving the loudspeaker were not timbrally desirable, we may be better off not hearing them, and the best option is to absorb or attenuate them. So, why not start with well-designed loudspeakers?

In terms of the “soundstage and imaging” consequences of early reflections there is much to be said (Chapter 7). There is significant variation in the results of investigations, whether one relies on consumer audio or professional audio experimental data and anecdotes. Some may be surprised to learn that the dominant factor in stereo “soundstage and imaging” is the recording itself (Section 7.4.2, p. 174). It is also clear that personal preference and habituation to certain circumstances are also factors, which explains personal preferences for some recordings over others, and notions about acoustical treatments that provide the greatest rewards. Some of the advice about acoustical treatment comes from sources with a financial interest, for whom “more” seems always to be “better,” and “what” is “what they sell.” It is not always wrong, but a questioning attitude is advised.

At this stage in the evolution of audio, listeners should be encouraged to embrace multichannel audio for music as well as movies. There is no reason why the L and R loudspeakers in a multichannel system cannot deliver state-of-the-art stereo. Having additional channels and loudspeakers in the room allows for the possibility of tasteful upmixing of stereo programs to enhance the sense of envelopment that only multiple channels can deliver persuasively. Some of the widely available upmixers are, in my opinion, overly enthusiastic about sending sound to the center and surround channels and in disrupting the front soundstage. However, there are some that please me, and today’s receivers and surround processors are flexible, placing the key parameters under the listener’s control. Experimentation is possible, and nothing is permanent.

Loudspeakers and rooms function as systems—both are involved in what we measure and hear in rooms—but nowhere is it more obvious than at bass frequencies, where room resonances dominate what is heard. Chapters 8 and 9 address the issues of delivering bass to listeners in small rooms. Bass accounts for about 30% of the perception of overall sound quality, so getting it right is important.

#### Introduction
There are three basic arrangements of loudspeakers to be considered at the present time: 
- Stereo
- 5.1 and 7.1
- Surround sound enhanced by elevated loudspeakers: immersive (3D) audio.

Stereo has been with us for about 60 years, and it remains the default format for music. Movies were a motivating factor for stereo, and movies have driven the desire for surround sound and now immersive sound. There are examples of multichannel music, and some are impressively good, but the impracticality of maintaining inventories of different physical formats has been a major cause of music still residing in two channels. Current streaming capabilities and the flexibility of downloadable playback algorithms offer hope for a future with an expanded repertoire of multichannel music pleasures.
Multichannel soundtracks accompany many music videos, they are compulsory in movies and some productions for TV are incorporating more elaborate audio. Upmixers can manipulate stereo music into surround or even immersive versions. Because the creators of stereo music did not anticipate such manipulations, not all of it responds favorably to upmixing. However, the author has found that a moderated application of upmixing provides a very pleasant increase in “envelopment,” tending to include the listener in the performance space. This is quite successful in the classical repertoire, and surprisingly often in the popular/jazz domain. The “stereo” button is always there. I rarely use it. 

Finding a pleasing upmixer is the challenge. Some popular ones are (for me) overly aggressive in enhancing the center channel and/or directing sound to the surround channels. However, modern receivers and especially powerful surround processors provide many customizable adjustments to rebalance amplitudes and delays for fronts and surrounds. Some experimentation of this kind is actually educational in that it quickly reveals just how different stereo mixes can be.

The point of this discussion is merely to point out that state-of-the-art stereo is available in multichannel audio systems but the reverse is not true. Therefore, in designing listening rooms, it is advisable to design a system that looks to the future, and has, or can have, multichannel capabilities. At the very least this means running wires through the structure for additional loudspeakers in some key locations. Some builders of new homes currently do this, but lacking good guidance, they sometimes get the locations wrong.

Defining those locations is one objective of this presentation. The L, C and R loudspeakers are well positioned to deliver excellent sound because they are, or should be, aimed at all listeners in the room. I still see photos of home theaters with all three front loudspeakers aiming straight out into the room. Why?

Side, rear and overhead loudspeakers can be more challenging. The reason is that, depending on how the loudspeakers are designed, positioned and mounted, the direct sound arriving at a listener might have left the loudspeaker at a considerably off axis angle. The important direct sound is degraded. Equalization to correct it will distort all other sounds leaving the loudspeaker, which negates one of the engineering objectives of good sounding loudspeakers. I often joke about a simple in-ceiling loudspeaker being optimally positioned to entertain the dog lying on the floor under it, not the humans in the room. 

This means that some thought must be given to the kind of loudspeakers used in the surround/immersive systems if listeners are to have the highest quality experience. This includes constraints imposed by the dwelling itself and by the customers, many of whom want “invisible” loudspeakers. Obviously, apartment dwellers cannot use in-wall/ceiling designs, so on-wall or bracket mounted small loudspeakers are the options. Listeners should be situated on axis or within a reasonable off-axis listening window of the in-/on-wall/ceiling loudspeakers for sound quality to be maximized. Some scaled room layout drawings and a protractor are required (or the computer graphic equivalent).

#### Basic Stereo and Multichannel Floor Plans
The principal requirement for stereo is two identical loudspeakers at equal distances from the listener (it is designed for only one listener) and located at about ± 30°, although smaller soundstages are common.

Chapter 15 provides a lot of detailed information on optimizing multichannel layouts. The following is just a sample.

The first iteration of surround sound employed four channels, L, C, R and one channel for the left and right surrounds. Fortunately, it was not long before the situation improved, first with decorrelated left/right side channels to improve the spatial impression, and then with five digital discrete channels: 5.1. The “.1” was for the subwoofer. Five discrete channels allow the recording engineer to control the delivery of directional and/or spatial impressions.

In the beginning, following the guidance of the defunct “quadraphonics,” people often interpreted the surround channels as “rear” channels and placed the loudspeakers behind them. As seen in Figure 1(a & b), the surround channels should be positioned mostly to the sides, to deliver good envelopment, and slightly behind the listener to create a slight rearward tendency so that flyovers can be effective. The worst possible (but all too common) arrangement is to have the rear loudspeakers at the same mirrored angles as the front L and R loudspeakers (see Figure 15.3, p. 407)—in terms of generating spaciousness, it is no better than stereo, although flyovers would be very persuasive.

It was not long before multichannel evolved into 7.1. This generally has been interpreted as 5.1 with two more channels added at the rear. However, if the desire is to optimize the spatial display, it is advisable to move the side loudspeakers forward for maximum spatial effect, and let the rear loudspeakers deliver impressive rear localizations and flyovers. This is shown in Figure 1 (c and d). If possible, this is the preferred layout.

If space is available, and the electronics can support the additional loudspeakers, Figure 1 (e and f) shows a 9.1 channel arrangement. If the −60° and −105° loudspeakers are driven by the same signal, as if they were a combined side channel, the −105° pair should be delayed by about 10 ms to add sufficient decorrelation to avoid interference effects (comb filtering). If they are used in immersive formats they are separate program channels and no special treatment is needed. Observant readers may have noticed that in (e and f) the rear loudspeakers mirror the front L and R, but here it is of no consequence because there are four side loudspeakers better positioned to deliver spatial effects.

Circular arrangements use a lot of space, are incompatible with most domestic rooms and, consequently, are rare. Differing distances in the common rectangular arrangements need to be compensated for using delays in the setup routine. The side wall loudspeakers have all been illustrated as on-wall types. They could have been in-wall designs. In either case Figure 1 (d) shows that the prime listener is 45° off the design axis of the rear loudspeakers. This is not likely to deliver a flat direct sound to the prime listener, and equalization is not a desirable solution. Elevation loudspeakers at ceiling height sometimes present even greater off-axis problems. There are two options: use bracket-mounted loudspeakers and aim them at the listener, as in Figure 1 (f); or select a loudspeaker that has good performance at that off-axis angle. The front side loudspeakers are within a reasonable listening window for this listener.
